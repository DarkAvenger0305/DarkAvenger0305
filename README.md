- I'm Dark.
- I spend my time tinkering with technology.
- I have 3 Active PC's.(Kinda)
- My Main PC is:
- CPU: AMD RYZEN 5 7600X
- GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4070
- My Second PC is:
- CPU: INTEL PENTIUM J4205
- GPU: INTEL HD GRAGHICS 505
- My third PC is just a Raspberry Pi with hopefully soon to be 5.25TB of Storage
- I also play games, aim to learn to know how to code and also do pixel art.
